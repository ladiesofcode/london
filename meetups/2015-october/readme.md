# Ladies Who Code LDN | [October 2015 - Lightning Talks, All Things Code](http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-UK/events/224931063/)

This month we had a brilliant round of lightning talks from our very own members! The subjects were wide ranging and the questions from the audience were on point. We'll definitely be running these again.

## Speaker decks & materials

+ [Alice Daish](https://twitter.com/alice_data) on [_'R Awesomeness'_](/20151006_LWC_Rawesomeness.pptx)

	Alice works as a data scientist for the British Museum and is a huge R enthusiast! While previously mainly used by scientists and statisticians, R has started to become more popuplar in companies now. With its over 7k different packages, Alice feels like R is usually able to solve her coding problems. She highlighted three packages which she finds particularly useful which are [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) for dynamic report generation, [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) and [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) which creates a graphical user interface without requiring any front end development skills.

+ [Corinne Welsh](https://twitter.com/corinnewelsh) on _'Learning Python'_

	Corinne talked about how she experimented with different methods to learn Python. She compared her learning journey to kissing frogs: sometimes they turn into a prince and sometimes they stay a frog. The princes amongst her different approaches turned out to be meetups ([PyLadies](http://www.pyladies.com/)) and conferences, workshops (Django Girls) and teaching others. She highlighted a particular conference setup where participants created a poster about a topic and others would talk to them about the poster. Corinne also created a raspberri pi project which she brought along to our meetup.

+ [Katerina Nuresh](https://twitter.com/knerush) on _'Wiki Art Project'_

	Katerina's message was: "Use your maternity leave (or other time off work) to learn something new!" And that's exactly what she did. Having previously worked as an ActionScript developer, she went and learnt iOS development and created an app for the Wiki Art Project. The Wiki Art Project's goal is to digitise all art ever created, using wiki principals. The iPhone app has approximately 25k monthly users now, proving that Katerina's design approach of creating a magazine like experience, focusing on content over design and maximising the time spent by the user was successful.

+ Ioana Vasilescu on [_'Clean Code'_](http://www.slideshare.net/VasilescuIoana/clean-code-53643686)

	Ioana introduced us to Clean Code, explained what it is and why we need it (for example to use the amount of WTFs during a code review - check out slide 3). Ways to achieve clean code include remembering that less is more, using proper naming and indentation, writing meaningful comments and practising Test Driven Development. Ioana highly recommends the book [Clean Code](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/) by Robert C. Martin.
	

+ [Nicola Aitken](https://twitter.com/aitkenster) on [_'Learning GoLang'_](https://www.haikudeck.com/learning-golang-science-and-technology-presentation-JfiY52YnYw)

	Having come from a Ruby background, Nicola is now passionate about Go. Not only does it support concurrency, which is a major talking point for all Go enthusiasts but it also encourages writing clean code and following good programming practises. And that is due to the strict compiler which for example doesn't allow any unused variables or packages and forces you to handle errors immediatly. With a spec that is only 50 pages long, the language is small and relatively quick to get up to speed with.

+ [Sue Spence](https://twitter.com/virtualsue) on _'Concurrency in Go'_

	Sue is very excited about Go, she even created her presentation slides using the language. This allowed her to execute programmes from within her presentation. She started off by giving an overview of the history of Go (created by Google engineers who had enough of working on C++ backend code) and then used several code examples to demonstrate how fast the language runs. Sue has started the [Women Who Go London meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Go-London/) to help promote diversity in the Go community.
	
+ Sundari spoke on '_Application Integration - how a Developer can think like an Architect_" without slides. 

	Sundari works as an integration developer and used the example of an online mobile phone shop to introduce us to the concepts of application integration and architecture. When selecting and buying a phone online, lots of different services run in the background, e.g. address lookup, finding suitable contract deals and finding different phones. All these services are joined together by enterprise application integration. When thinking about service oriented architecture, the developer needs to think from a business point of view and consider each model as a service that can stand alone.
