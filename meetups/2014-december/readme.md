##Speakers
**[Trisha Gee](http://trishagee.com/)**, all the way from Sevilla in Spain, is an expert in Java high performance systems, is passionate about enabling developer productivity and currently works for MongoDB, an open-source document database, and the leading NoSQL database.

He and **[Natalia Baltazar](https://twitter.com/natalialkb)** from [Founders & Coders](http://www.foundersandcoders.org) talked about their experience and how you can contribute and encourage contributions at any level. Oli also talked about the fantastic [24 pull requests](http://24pullrequests.com/) initiative.
