#Ladies Who Code LDN | [December 2015](http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-UK/events/226673924/)

In honor of the festive season, Ladies Who Code is partnered with [Codebar](http://www.codebar.io), [24 Pull Requests](http://www.24pullrequests.com) and [YourFirstPR](http://yourfirstpr.github.io/) for a special day of contributing to open source projects. 

It was a wonderful day with lots of fantastic ladies and gents showing up at Twitter HQ in London to spend the day giving little gifts of code.

## Speakers and materials [speaker decks TO BE ADDED in due course]
We started off the day with 3 lightning talks:
+ [Ju Liu](https://twitter.com/arkh4m)
+ [Charlotte Spencer](https://twitter.com/Charlotteis) on [YourFirstPR and how to write good issues](https://slidr.io/Charlotteis/codebar-your-first-pr#1) as a project maintainer
+ [Andrew Nesbitt](https://twitter.com/teabass) on [24 Pull Requests](http://www.24pullrequests.com)

## Notes on the day
At the end of the day we held a very quick verbal retrospective. 

### To improve on for next year
+ We need a bigger list of issues for people to work on with more variation in languages
  + It's useful for people to know how to search for issues, but it may take up too much time on the day
  + Java and C++ were the ones most notably absent from the list this year
+ There should be a max of 2 students to 1 coach, a couple ended up with 3 and that was a little overwhelming
+ Coaches should also bring their laptops (so they can help to look for adequate issues to work on and general research)
+ We must never, ever forget to keep topping up the coffee, particularly after lunch!
+ Out of our control but worth mentioning, people found that a lot of projects lacked good documentation, particularly on how to run projects or run tests

### Things that went well
+ The food and cookies were great
+ The issues that were listed on the sheet as possibilities for people to work on were awesome
+ Very fun working on a real project and isn’t just a tiny example project individuals had put together for learning purposes
+ A lot of good input from the coaches which was very appreciated by students
+ Some relatively new coaches learned a lot about being a coach on the day too
+ Venue (Twitter HQ) was lovely
+ It was really great to see the spreadsheet of issues at the end of the day to get some idea of how many PRs had been tackled collectively   

[Added by [@iteles](http://www.github.com/iteles) - things to not forget next year:
+ We asked all PRs to contain `@ladieswhocode` or `@codebar` in the description so that we could tally up how many PRs had been contributed as a result of the event
+ We did a little walk-through on the big screen of _how_ to search for an issue in Github that you might be able to contribute to]
