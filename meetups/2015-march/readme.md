#Ladies Who Code LDN | March 2015

This month's meetup was a **Public Speaking workshop for Novices** with [Trisha Gee](https://twitter.com/trisha_gee) and lots of great input from [Mazz Mosley](https://twitter.com/mnowster).

###Speaker deck:
+ To be added!

###Notes:
The below are some notes taken by [Ines](https://twitter.com/iteles) throughout and roughly organised into categories (given a lot of the great content from the night was a result of questions asked by everyone there). **Pull requests welcome** for any changes and additional points worth sharing with everyone!

####Dealing with difficult questions
+ Set expectations upfront on whether you’ll have time to answer questions
+ If you’re super nervous at the end of the talk, it’s ok to say ‘I’m sure you’ll appreciate, it’s pretty nerve-wracking to be up here so I won’t be taking any questions from the stage but come find me after’
+ If you get a question and you don't know what some of the terms are referring to: "Can you clarify for everyone what x y and z mean to make sure everyone’s on the same page?"
+ **Always take things in the best possible way.** If people don’t ask any questions, that must mean you've already answered all of their questions!
+ It's ok to say you don't know, but point people in the direction of who does

####Preparing a talk
+ For calls for proposals, make titles either catchy or buzz word filled (and indicate the level your talk is aimed at)
+ Recommended reading for putting together the actual presentation: [Presentation Patterns](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Presentation-Patterns-Techniques-Crafting-Presentations/dp/0321820800)
+ Find **3 big things** you want to impart and build your talk around those
+ **Repetition is good** - it'll be awkward for you, but it's positive!
    

####Practicing a talk
+ **Everyone has different ways of practicing** - you could practice once or write out your whole script verbatim
+ Practicing a 5 min talk is more about just checking you're not going crazy over time
+ For longer talks - practice at least once out loud
+ Live demos: Practice out loud quite a few times with the full demo run-through
+ **Tips:**
  + Try out your talks at meetups
  + Try them out especially at meetups that film you and watch it back _(hint: LWC London will have optional recording of talks from April 2015 onwards!)_
  + Start a book club and have everyone present for 5 mins, teaching or talking through something that you struggled with

####Getting comfortable with presenting
  + **Co-presenting** is a really great way to get started
  + **_For eye contact:_** Just scan the crowd; you don't really have to make eye contact
  + **_On speaking slower:_** Don't be afraid of silence, it's ok to stop. For a 50 minute talk, try to have max 40 mins of content so you're forced to slow down.
  + **_On what to do with your hands:_** Get someone to take a short video of you when you're comfortable and talking to your friends, then figure out what you're doing with your hands and mimic that
  + Remember **people aren't in your head**, don't worry about that one example you forgot to mention - no one else knows!

**How can you tell if people are paying attention?** Usually you can tell. Body language is relatively relaxed, people are looking engaged.

Be yourself. **If none of this works for you, do _exactly_ what feels comfortable. No more, no less**
