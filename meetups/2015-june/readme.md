#Ladies Who Code LDN | [June 2015](http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-UK/events/222452944/)

This month's meetup was on Test Driven Development for Javascript. Natalia introduced the concept of TDD and Nelson guided a [mini workshop using QUnit and testing in the browser](#speaker-decks--materials).    
_Although the meetup concentrated on full stack Javascript testing, the principles of TDD can be applied to any development environment._

[Nelson Correia](https://github.com/nelsonic) has been a full stack Javascript developer at many different companies, including Groupon, Thomas Cook and Pearson Publishing. He's now the lead  mentor at [Founders & Coders](http://www.foundersandcoders.com/academy/) by day and prolific developer of open source projects and tutorials by night (and early morning). 

[Natalia Baltazar](https://github.com/NataliaLKB) is a [Founders & Coders](http://www.foundersandcoders.com/academy/) alumni who has been a developer for 7 months now. She has already worked on projects for Camden Council and a freighting company and is a strong proponent of TDD.
