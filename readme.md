We used to be called Ladies Who Code but changed our name to Ladies of Code. So if you came here expecting to find LWC - you're not going mad! Here is the [the announcement](https://medium.com/@lalamaguire/ladies-who-code-is-no-more-f95a81a635a4#.wqjto3bon) about our name change.

[Our new website](https://www.ladiesofcode.com/) is in the process of being developed but for now we're using this repo for [past presentations](#previous-meetup-materials), [newsletter links](#past-newsletters) and interesting bits and pieces.

Please spend **2 minutes letting us know what you'd like to see in upcoming meetups** [using this survey](https://ladiesofcode.typeform.com/to/rvoSfJ)!
