##February 2015 Survey Results
###Summary
In February 2015 we ran a short survey (seriously, the average completion time was just under 2 minutes) to understand more about what the ladies of LWC wanted from the meetups.**Thanks to all those who answered**, this is super helpful!
If you have any ideas on any of these or even if you want to **organise a LWC meetup yourself** (we'll help with venue, food, etc of course), just [get in touch!](mailto:ladieswhocodeLDN@gmail.com)

* In terms of _**topics**_, by far and away the most requested topics were: **Javascript (both generally & frameworks), databases** and **Test Driven Development**
  * These were followed closely by **coding on the processor** and **HTML5/CSS3**
  * A little further behind those were **web app security, cryptography** and **Node.js**
  * Bringing up the 'rear' were **Swift, other backend technologies** and **continuous delivery**, but these still had _**20% of the votes**_ which is quite a lot of interest given the size of our community!

![More of these topics please!](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4185328/6547451/77615668-c5d0-11e4-8085-f2c327aee213.png)

* When it comes to _**types of events**_ it looks like what we really want is to **get down to some real, practical coding**
  * And it looks like we want **both advanced AND beginner sessions** - what's that they say about not being able to please everyone? :wink:
  * But if you look at the percentages, really what it tells is that we want **All. The. Things.**


![More of these meetups please!](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4185328/6547450/76582d82-c5d0-11e4-831f-367a526ad731.png)

###What we're going to do about it in 2015
We're excited to get stuck into finding speakers for the topics you want to hear more about - we've already started, so watch this space.
We'll be trying to **incorporate more practical coding** into the meetups straight away, but this demands not only some organisation time from the co-organisers but more importantly, _lots_ of prep time from our speakers. We'll try it out and see how we go.
We'll also try out hand at a couple of nights which are **start-to-finish coding workshops** (though we're open to suggestions on whether these should be _in addition_ to our monthly meetups). These will take a while to organise we reckon so may be **later in the year**.

We have a few of ideas on how to make this happen but please **find us at meetups and tell us yours!**
