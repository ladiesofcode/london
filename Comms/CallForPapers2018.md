# Ladies of Code Call for Papers 2018 


Hi Ladies,
We hope you are having a nice and warm holiday season.

Last September we run a workshop to [Find your inner tech talk](https://www.meetup.com/Ladies-of-Code-UK/events/242349534) and your response was amazing. Many Ladies of Code finished the session with a topic to talk about and we want to hear all about it! 

We are looking for speakers for our meetup on the 3rd of April. If you’d like to apply send us your submission via **[message to the organisers on the meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/Ladies-of-Code-UK/members/?op=leaders)** page with your details **before 18th of February**.

**About the talks:**

What: 20 minute long technical talk. The topic can be about anything tech related.

When: 3rd of April.

Who: Any member of the Ladies of Code London meetup can send their submission. If you didn’t come to the workshop but have something interesting to talk about we definitely want to know about it.



What do you need to send in your application:
* Your name and email address so we can contact you
* A brief summary of your background and expertise just so we can get to know you a little better
* Your Twitter handler (optional) 
* The talk’s topic
* A brief summary on your talk.




Looking forward to hear from you before the 18th of February,
Ladies of Code
